FeatureProbe is an open source **feature management service**. 
It allows R&D, SRE and operation teams to launch new features or switch software implementations with confidence and lower risk.
FeatureProbe eliminates manual delays through its practice in continuous delivery and is not hindered by the size of a 
team or the complexity of a product, which allows developers to maintain their velocity. 
It also enables the operation team to change online service parameters within seconds or roll out configurations progressively 
without effort.
